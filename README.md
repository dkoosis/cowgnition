## Have you Herd?

CowGnition connects your [Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) (RTM) tasks with Claude Desktop. This MCP server lets you ask your AI assistant to manage your to-do lists, look up due dates, and get insights about your tasks through simple conversations. The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) allows Claude Desktop, and other conversational agents that are MCP clients, to use "tools" like RTM to do things on your behalf.

## Key Features

- **Create and update tasks** - Add new items or modify existing ones
- **Complete tasks** - Check things off right from Claude
- **Manage due dates** - Schedule and reschedule with natural language

## Installation

```bash
# Install directly (easiest)
go install [github.com/dkoosis/cowgnition@latest](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/dkoosis/cowgnition%40latest)

# Or build from source
git clone [https://github.com/dkoosis/cowgnition.git](https://github.com/dkoosis/cowgnition.git)
cd cowgnition
make build
# Optionally run tests to verify
make test
```

## Configuration

1. Get Your RTM Credentials
   Head over to the Remember The Milk API key page to get your API key and shared secret.

2. Create Your Config
   Create a configuration file at configs/config.yaml with the following content:

```YAML

server:
  name: "CowGnition RTM"
  port: 8080

rtm:
  api_key: "your_api_key"
  shared_secret: "your_shared_secret"

auth:
  # Directory to store authentication tokens.
  # Ensure this directory exists or the application has permissions to create it.
  token_path: "~/.config/cowgnition/tokens"
```

(Note: The application may need the directory specified in auth.token_path to exist.)

3. Start It Up

```Bash

# Ensure you are in the cloned repository directory if built from source
./cowgnition serve --config configs/config.yaml
```

4. Connect to Claude
   Install it in Claude Desktop:

```Bash

mcp install --name "Remember The Milk" --command cowgnition --args "serve --config configs/config.yaml"
```

Or test it first with:

```Bash

mcp dev --command ./cowgnition --args "serve --config configs/config.yaml"
```

## What Can CowGnition Do?

Once connected to Claude Desktop, just start chatting naturally:

"What's due today on RTM?"
"Add milk to my shopping list"
"Show me all my tasks tagged as 'important'"
"Set the dentist appointment for next Tuesday"
"What's on my work list in Remember The Milk?"

## Authentication

First time connecting? Here's how it works:

Ask Claude about your Remember The Milk tasks
Claude provides an authorization link from CowGnition
Visit the link and approve CowGnition access to your RTM account on rememberthemilk.com
You'll get a special code (frob)
Tell Claude this code
You're connected!
Your RTM credentials stay secure throughout this process using OAuth.

## Under the Hood

CowGnition uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect Claude with your RTM account. For the technically curious, here's what Claude can access:

### Resources

auth://rtm - Your gateway to RTM
tasks://today - See what's due today
tasks://list/{list_id} - View tasks in specific lists
lists://all - Browse your RTM lists
tags://all - See all your organizational tags

### Tools

CowGnition gives Claude these capabilities:

Creating tasks in any list
Completing tasks
Changing due dates
Setting priorities
Adding tags

## And more!
