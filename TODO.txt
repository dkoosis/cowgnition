# CowGnition - MCP Server Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation steps for the CowGnition MCP server, which connects Claude Desktop to Remember The Milk through the Model Context Protocol. It's structured as a series of prompts optimized for efficient collaboration with an AI coding assistant.

## Optimal Work Session Format

1. **Review**: Begin by reviewing this TODO document and the current state of the repository
2. **Plan**: Identify the next task and break it down into smaller components
3. **Implement**: Write code for one component at a time, following Go best practices
4. **Test**: Verify the implementation works as expected
5. **Document**: Update comments, README, and this TODO document
6. **Commit**: Save changes with descriptive commit messages

## Collaboration Guidelines

When working with AI on this project:

1. Always start by reviewing this TODO document to identify the next tasks
2. Ensure you're working with the current repository state
3. Follow Go best practices:
   - Use comprehensive comments (with function documentation)
   - Implement thorough error handling with wrapping
   - Write idiomatic Go code (using standard libraries when possible)
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Create small, focused functions with clear responsibilities
4. Update this TODO document after completing each section
5. Commit changes in logical units with descriptive messages

## Implementation Roadmap

### 2. RTM Authentication Flow

```
Review the implementation for security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks. Implement rate limiting, caching, and error resilience. Add logging for debugging and telemetry.
```

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Core MCP Server Framework - Completed on March 14, 2025
```
Enhanced the core MCP server framework following the Model Context Protocol specifications:
1. Completed the MCPServer implementation in internal/server/server.go:
   - Added proper error handling with context-rich errors
   - Improved JSON response formatting with helper functions
   - Implemented consistent logging
   - Created middleware for request logging

2. Improved MCP protocol compliance:
   - Standardized response formats using types from pkg/mcp
   - Added proper HTTP status codes
   - Implemented content-type headers
   - Enhanced error reporting

3. Improved code organization:
   - Created helper methods for common operations
   - Separated resource handling logic into dedicated functions
   - Added comprehensive documentation
```
Enhance the authentication flow for Remember The Milk. Implement proper frob handling, token management, and authentication persistence. Add support for permission levels and token refresh.
```

### 3. Task Resources Implementation

```
Implement resources for tasks. This includes task listing with filtering (all, today, tomorrow, week), individual task retrieval, and proper formatting for MCP context exposure. Use proper pagination for large task lists.
```

### 4. List Resources Implementation

```
Implement resources for RTM lists. This includes listing all lists, filtering by type (smart lists, regular lists), and retrieving list metadata. Include list statistics like task counts.
```

### 5. Tag Resources Implementation

```
Implement resources for RTM tags. This includes listing all tags, retrieving tasks by tag, and tag usage statistics. Add support for tag hierarchies if available in the RTM API.
```

### 6. Task Management Tools

```
Implement tools for task management: creation, completion, deletion, due date management, and priority setting. Ensure proper error handling and validation for all operations.
```

### 7. List Management Tools

```
Implement tools for list management: creation, deletion, renaming, and archiving. Include support for task movement between lists and list organization.
```

### 8. Tag Management Tools

```
Implement tools for tag management: adding/removing tags from tasks, creating/deleting tags, and renaming tags. Add support for batch operations on multiple tasks.
```

### 9. Note Management Tools

```
Implement tools for note management: adding, editing, and deleting notes on tasks. Support rich text formatting if available in the RTM API.
```

### 10. Search and Filter Tools

```
Implement search and filter tools using RTM's query syntax. Support complex filters (priority, date ranges, text search) with proper formatting of results.
```

### 11. Testing and Documentation

```
Write comprehensive tests for the implementation. This includes unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the full server. Update the documentation with complete usage examples.
```

### 12. Client Integration Support

```
Add specific support for Claude Desktop integration. This includes installation instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips. Create example prompts for common RTM operations.
```

### 13. Security and Performance Optimization

```
