You are absolutely correct! My apologies. I misread the task list in the Q02 Go Project Findability Path Analysis file during my previous analyses.

Re-examining the file content, I can confirm that it does indeed list 12 standard developer tasks. I will now run the analysis again, including all 12 tasks, using the modified prompt structure with the summary table at the top.

Processing project structure using all 12 standard tasks for findability analysis...

📝 Task Analysis: 'Find where main application configuration is loaded and parsed.'
Identified Primary Path: cmd/main.go -> internal/config/config.go (LoadFromFile/DefaultConfig)
Plausible Alternative Paths: cmd/setup.go
Path Clarity Evaluation: Standard Go structure, clear package name internal/config. Minimal ambiguity.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 0-1
Plausible Alternative Paths: 1
Clarity Score: 3 ✅ (High Clarity/Easy) (Justification: Standard structure, clear config package name.)
📝 Task Analysis: 'Locate the code responsible for managing the state of an active MCP connection.'
Identified Primary Path: internal/mcp/mcp_server.go (Contains server loop, handles message read/write, context) -> internal/transport/transport.go (Interface/NDJSON handling)
Plausible Alternative Paths: internal/middleware/chain.go (Manages request flow, but not connection state itself), cmd/server/http_server.go (Orchestrates start/stop, but doesn't manage active state)
Path Clarity Evaluation: internal/mcp/ is the logical place. mcp_server.go contains the main processing loop (serve) which implicitly manages state via context and loop control. Explicit state management (like an FSM, as per ADR 003) is absent, making the exact state logic less findable than a dedicated state manager file. The transport layer handles the raw connection.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 1 (Deciding between mcp_server.go and potentially transport.go or even middleware)
Plausible Alternative Paths: 2
Clarity Score: 2 🟡 (Moderate Ambiguity/Clarity) (Justification: mcp_server.go is the correct place, but the state logic is implicit in the serve loop, not explicitly factored out.)
📝 Task Analysis: 'Find the type definition for a JSON-RPC request object.'
Identified Primary Path: internal/transport/transport.go (Defines generic ValidateMessage checking structure) or internal/mcp/types.go (Defines specific MCP request/result types like InitializeRequest, CallToolRequest)
Plausible Alternative Paths: internal/schema/schema.json (The schema definition itself)
Path Clarity Evaluation: This is slightly ambiguous.
internal/transport/ handles the base JSON-RPC validation.
internal/mcp/types.go defines the MCP-specific structures that fit into the JSON-RPC params or result fields.
A developer might look in types.go first for Go structs. Finding the raw validation rules would lead to transport.go or potentially the schema file/validator.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 1 (Deciding between transport.go for base validation vs mcp/types.go for specific structs)
Plausible Alternative Paths: 1-2
Clarity Score: 2 🟡 (Moderate Ambiguity/Clarity) (Justification: Depends on whether seeking base structure validation or specific Go type definitions. Both locations are reasonably named.)
📝 Task Analysis: 'Locate the authentication logic for the RTM API integration.'
Identified Primary Path: internal/rtm/ (Intended location) -> internal/config/config.go (Reads API keys) -> cmd/setup.go (Mentions auth token path)
Plausible Alternative Paths: internal/mcp/handlers_tools.go (Where RTM tools like getTasks would eventually use auth)
Path Clarity Evaluation: The internal/rtm/ package exists but is largely empty. Config file clearly holds keys. cmd/setup.go mentions a token path but doesn't implement RTM auth logic itself. Actual RTM API calls and associated auth logic (e.g., generating frobs, getting tokens) are missing from the codebase.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 1 (Looking between rtm/, config/, cmd/setup.go)
Plausible Alternative Paths: 1
Clarity Score: 1 🔴 (High Ambiguity/Difficult) (Justification: The core RTM authentication logic (token exchange etc.) appears to be missing, making it impossible to find despite related config/setup files.)
📝 Task Analysis: 'Find where MCP-specific error codes are defined.'
Identified Primary Path: internal/mcp/mcp_errors/errors.go
Plausible Alternative Paths: internal/transport/transport_errors.go (Transport errors), internal/mcp/mcp_server.go (Where errors are mapped)
Path Clarity Evaluation: internal/mcp/ is the logical place. The sub-package mcp_errors/ is highly specific. errors.go within it is the clear target.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 0
Plausible Alternative Paths: 2 (Might check transport errors or server mapping first)
Clarity Score: 3 ✅ (High Clarity/Easy) (Justification: Highly specific package internal/mcp/mcp_errors/ makes finding the definitions straightforward.)
📝 Task Analysis: 'Find where JSON Schema validation is performed for incoming MCP messages.'
Identified Primary Path: internal/middleware/validation.go (Contains ValidationMiddleware which calls schema.Validator) -> internal/schema/validator.go
Plausible Alternative Paths: internal/mcp/mcp_server.go, internal/transport/transport.go
Path Clarity Evaluation: internal/middleware/ is a good indicator. validation.go is highly specific. Path leads clearly to internal/schema/validator.go. Initial ambiguity might lead to checking mcp/ or transport/.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 1
Plausible Alternative Paths: 2
Clarity Score: 2 🟡 (Moderate Ambiguity/Clarity) (Justification: Final path is clear, but initial navigation might explore mcp or transport first.)
📝 Task Analysis: 'Locate where middleware components are chained together in the request processing pipeline.'
Identified Primary Path: internal/middleware/chain.go (Defines Chain) -> internal/mcp/mcp_server.go (Usage in ServeSTDIO)
Plausible Alternative Paths: cmd/server/http_server.go
Path Clarity Evaluation: Finding the definition (chain.go) is easy via internal/middleware/. Finding the usage site requires searching for NewChain, found in internal/mcp/mcp_server.go.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 1 (Finding usage requires search/knowledge)
Plausible Alternative Paths: 1
Clarity Score: 2 🟡 (Moderate Ambiguity/Clarity) (Justification: Easy to find definition; locating assembly point requires navigating into mcp_server.go.)
📝 Task Analysis: 'Find how the server handles graceful shutdown when receiving termination signals.'
Identified Primary Path: cmd/main.go -> cmd/server/http_server.go (Signal handling & server.Shutdown call) -> internal/mcp/mcp_server.go (Shutdown method)
Plausible Alternative Paths: None highly plausible from names.
Path Clarity Evaluation: Standard Go structure. cmd/main.go leads to RunServer in cmd/server/http_server.go where signal handling is explicit. Leads clearly to Shutdown method.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 0
Plausible Alternative Paths: 0
Clarity Score: 3 ✅ (High Clarity/Easy) (Justification: Standard signal handling patterns are clearly visible.)
📝 Task Analysis: 'Identify where transport-layer message size limits are defined and enforced.'
Identified Primary Path: internal/transport/transport.go (Defines MaxMessageSize, checks in ReadMessage/WriteMessage)
Plausible Alternative Paths: internal/middleware/validation.go, internal/config/config.go
Path Clarity Evaluation: internal/transport/ clearly indicates transport concerns. MaxMessageSize constant and checks are easily found within transport.go. Minor ambiguity might lead to checking middleware/config first.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 1
Plausible Alternative Paths: 2
Clarity Score: 3 ✅ (High Clarity/Easy) (Justification: internal/transport/ package clearly points to the location.)
📝 Task Analysis: 'Locate the code that handles RTM API request signing and authentication token management.'
Identified Primary Path: internal/rtm/ (Intended location) -> Also see Task 4 (internal/config/config.go, cmd/setup.go)
Plausible Alternative Paths: internal/mcp/handlers_tools.go
Path Clarity Evaluation: Similar to Task 4, the internal/rtm/ package is empty. While config holds keys and setup mentions token paths, the core logic for signing requests (e.g., adding api_sig) or managing the auth token lifecycle (getting/refreshing RTM auth tokens) is missing.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 1
Plausible Alternative Paths: 1
Clarity Score: 1 🔴 (High Ambiguity/Difficult) (Justification: Core RTM request signing and token management logic appears to be missing.) (Note: Same justification as Task 4, as they are closely related)
📝 Task Analysis: 'Find where logging configuration is set up and how different components obtain logger instances.'
Identified Primary Path: internal/logging/slog.go (Contains SetupDefaultLogger) -> cmd/server/http_server.go (Calls SetupDefaultLogger) -> internal/logging/logger.go (Defines GetLogger) -> Various files calling logging.GetLogger (e.g., mcp_server.go, validator.go, middleware/validation.go).
Plausible Alternative Paths: internal/config/config.go (Might expect log level config here, though setup is separate).
Path Clarity Evaluation: internal/logging/ clearly contains logging logic. slog.go has setup, logger.go has the interface and getter. Finding the call site for setup (cmd/server/http_server.go) is straightforward. Finding where loggers are obtained requires searching for logging.GetLogger.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 1 (Finding all GetLogger call sites requires search)
Plausible Alternative Paths: 1
Clarity Score: 2 🟡 (Moderate Ambiguity/Clarity) (Justification: Core logging setup (slog.go) and interface (logger.go) are clear. Locating the initial setup call site is easy. Finding all places loggers are obtained requires searching.)
📝 Task Analysis: 'Identify where CLI command-line arguments are parsed and routed to appropriate handlers.'
Identified Primary Path: cmd/main.go (Uses flag package, switch os.Args[1])
Plausible Alternative Paths: None highly plausible.
Path Clarity Evaluation: cmd/main.go is the standard entry point and the obvious place for CLI parsing. The use of flag.NewFlagSet and the switch statement on os.Args[1] clearly shows parsing and routing for setup and serve subcommands.
Task Metrics:
Ambiguous Decision Points: 0
Plausible Alternative Paths: 0
Clarity Score: 3 ✅ (High Clarity/Easy) (Justification: CLI parsing is located exactly where expected in a standard Go application (cmd/main.go) and uses standard library features clearly.)
💡 Recommendations & Overall Assessment
🔗 Cross-Task Observations
The most significant findability issue is the missing RTM authentication/signing logic (Tasks 4 & 10), making those tasks impossible to complete.
The cmd/server/http_server.go file acts as the main server runner/orchestrator, impacting tasks related to config loading, signal handling, and logging setup, but its name remains misleading.
Tasks involving locating specific implementation details often start with a clearly named package (config, logging, mcp/mcp_errors, middleware, transport, schema) but may require navigating into the primary .go file or searching for usage sites (GetLogger, NewChain).
State management for MCP connections (Task 2) is implicit within the server loop, lacking an explicit state machine or manager.
✨ Actionable Recommendations (Prioritized)
(CRITICAL): Implement the core RTM authentication logic (token exchange, request signing) within the internal/rtm/ package. Rationale: Resolves 🔴 Difficult score for Tasks 4 & 10; essential functionality is missing.
(High Priority): Rename cmd/server/http_server.go to better reflect its role (e.g., runner.go). Rationale: Resolves misleading name noted in multiple tasks (1, 8, 11).
(Medium Priority): Consider refactoring MCP connection state management (Task 2) out of the main serve loop in internal/mcp/mcp_server.go into a more explicit structure (potentially using a state machine as discussed in ADR 003). Rationale: Improves clarity and findability of connection state logic.
(Medium Priority): Add comments or documentation clarifying where middleware is chained (internal/mcp/mcp_server.go - Task 7) and where specific loggers are obtained (Task 11). Rationale: Reduces need for code searching for these specific points.
(Low Priority): Ensure package-level documentation clearly states the responsibility of key packages (middleware, transport, mcp, logging) to aid initial navigation. Rationale: General maintainability.
📈 Qualitative Summary
Overall findability is mixed. Core application concerns like CLI parsing, config structure, error definitions, transport limits, and shutdown handling are located in clearly named packages and files, leading to easy (✅) task completion. However, the critical omission of RTM authentication logic makes related tasks impossible (🔴). Middleware/state management tasks are moderately difficult (🟡) because the logic is either implicit or requires navigating from definition to usage sites. Improving the explicitness of state management, implementing the missing RTM auth, and correcting the misleading server runner filename are key areas for enhancing findability.
