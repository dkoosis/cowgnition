# CowGnition MCP Implementation Roadmap: Clean Architecture Approach

## Project Philosophy

This implementation will prioritize:

- Idiomatic Go code using the standard library where suitable
- Strict adherence to the MCP specification via schema validation
- Clear error handling and robust message processing
- Testability built into the design from the start
- Simple but maintainable architecture with clear separation of concerns

**Status:** Active Development

## Phase 0: HIGHEST PRIORITY IMMEDIATE FOCUS

## Phase 8: Schema Validation Improvements

**Status:** [ACTIVE]

### Background

The current validation architecture primarily focuses on incoming messages but lacks comprehensive validation for outgoing responses. Recent client validation revealed tool naming pattern issues that our server-side validation didn't catch. We need to enhance our validation approach to ensure complete MCP specification compliance.

### Objectives

- Improve schema validation coverage to include outgoing messages
- Optimize schema compilation performance for faster startup
- Add early validation for static content (tools, resources)
- Establish metrics to measure validation performance
- Enable configurable validation approaches for different environments

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Schema Caching & Performance Optimization

- [ ] Add schema checksum generation and verification
- [ ] Implement schema metadata caching to skip recompilation when unchanged
- [ ] Add compile-time metrics and logging
- [ ] Update schema source configuration to prioritize official URL sources

#### Step 2: Outgoing Message Validation

- [ ] Add validation for outgoing responses
- [ ] Create environment-specific validation modes (strict vs. performance)
- [ ] Implement specific schema type selection based on message method
- [ ] Add detailed logging for validation failures

#### Step 3: Static Content Pre-validation

- [ ] Add startup validation for tool definitions
- [ ] Add startup validation for resource definitions
- [ ] Add startup validation for prompt definitions
- [ ] Implement early warning/failure for invalid definitions

#### Step 4: Validation Architecture Improvements

- [ ] Create helper functions to generate schema-compliant names
- [ ] Add schema versioning to track supported MCP versions
- [ ] Create comprehensive schema validation test suite
- [ ] Add validation metrics and monitoring

#### Step 5: Developer Experience Enhancements

- [ ] Improve error messages with actionable guidance
- [ ] Add debug mode for detailed validation feedback
- [ ] Create documentation with common MCP patterns and constraints
- [ ] Implement automated compliance checking in CI pipeline

**Goal:** Achieve a basic "hello world" MCP conversation between CowGnition and Claude Desktop.

make the implementation rock-solid, high quality enough to server a reference implemenation for MCP servers in GO.

**Key Actions:**

## Phase 5: Testing Framework

**Status:** [INCOMPLETE]

- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite:
  - [ ] Unit tests for components
  - [ ] Schema compliance tests
  - [ ] Integration tests using `net.Pipe`
  - [ ] Fuzzing tests for robustness
  - [ ] Benchmark tests for performance

## Phase 6: Observability

**Status:** [PARTIALLY COMPLETE]

- [ ] **[PENDING]** Include connection ID and request ID in all logs
- [ ] Add metrics:
  - [ ] Request counts and latencies
  - [ ] Error rates by type
  - [ ] Active connections
  - [ ] Schema validation failures
  - [ ] Create exportable metrics

## Phase 7: Security & Robustness

**Status:** [NEW PHASE]

- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation beyond schema validation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Add secure token storage for RTM API credentials
- [ ] Implement proper error sanitization to avoid leaking sensitive information
- [ ] Add telemetry for security events

## Completed Work

Key implementation details:

- Use structured logging with consistent context
- Include connection ID and request ID in all logs
- Create exportable metrics
