# Reorganized CowGnition - MCP Server Implementation Roadmap

    This document outlines the roadmap for implementing and improving the CowGnition MCP server.

    ##   High Priority

    ###   1. Testing Infrastructure Reorganization

    **Status:** In Progress

    This section focuses on restructuring the testing infrastructure for improved clarity, maintainability, and future extensibility.

    -   **MCP Conformance Testing Organization:**

        -  _Future:_ Establish patterns for additional service conformance tests (currently RTM is the only supported service).

    -   **Documentation Updates:**
        -  Add testing guidelines for new and existing developers (in `GO_PRACTICES.md` or a dedicated testing document).
        -  Document patterns for adding new service integrations (future consideration).

    ###   5. Testing and Verification

    **Status:** In Progress

    A comprehensive testing suite is being created and refined.

    -   **RTM integration tests:**

        -  _Future:_ More comprehensive integration tests, potentially with live RTM interaction.

    -   **Test automation:**
        -  Configure CI/CD for automated testing (pending infrastructure setup).
        -  Create reproducible test environments (partially addressed with mock RTM server).

    ##   Completed Items

    ###   1. Testing Infrastructure Reorganization

    -   **Implement New Test Directory Structure:**

        -   [x] Create new `test/mcp/` directory hierarchy.
        -   [x] Move existing test files to appropriate locations within `test/mcp/`.
        -   [x] Update import paths in all test files.
        -   [x] Eliminate duplicate test helpers and utilities. Consolidate in `test/mcp/helpers/`.
        -   [x] Verify all tests pass with the new structure.

    -   **MCP Conformance Testing Organization:**

        -   [x] Centralize MCP protocol validators in `test/mcp/helpers/`.
        -   [x] Create reusable test frameworks for MCP conformance (using `helpers.MCPClient`).

    -   **Documentation Updates:**
        -   [x] Update `PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md` to reflect the new test structure.
        -   [x] Add developer documentation (ongoing - `PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md`, `GO_PRACTICES.md`).

    ###   2. MCP Protocol Compliance

    **Status:** Complete

    CowGnition fully implements the MCP specification. This involved:

        -   [x] Identified any missing capabilities or endpoints.
        -   [x] Verified message formats and response structures.
        -   [x] Ensured proper error handling format (JSON-RPC 2.0).

    -   **Complete protocol implementation:**

        -   [x] Proper initialization sequence and capability reporting.
        -   [x] Complete resource definitions and implementations.
        -   [x] Proper tool registration and execution.
