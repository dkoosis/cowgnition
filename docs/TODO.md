# CowGnition MCP Implementation Roadmap: Clean Architecture Approach

## Project Philosophy

This implementation will prioritize:

- Idiomatic Go code using the standard library where suitable
- Strict adherence to the MCP specification via schema validation
- Clear error handling and robust message processing
- Testability built into the design from the start
- Simple but maintainable architecture with clear separation of concerns

**Status:** Active Development

## Phase 0: HIGHEST PRIORITY IMMEDIATE FOCUS

**Goal:** Achieve a basic "hello world" MCP conversation between CowGnition and Claude Desktop.

make the implementation rock-solid, high quality enough to server a reference implemenation for MCP servers in GO.

**Key Actions:**

## Phase 5: Testing Framework

**Status:** [INCOMPLETE]

- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite:
  - [ ] Unit tests for components
  - [ ] Schema compliance tests
  - [ ] Integration tests using `net.Pipe`
  - [ ] Fuzzing tests for robustness
  - [ ] Benchmark tests for performance

## Phase 6: Observability

**Status:** [PARTIALLY COMPLETE]

- [ ] **[PENDING]** Include connection ID and request ID in all logs
- [ ] Add metrics:
  - [ ] Request counts and latencies
  - [ ] Error rates by type
  - [ ] Active connections
  - [ ] Schema validation failures
  - [ ] Create exportable metrics

## Phase 7: Security & Robustness

**Status:** [NEW PHASE]

- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation beyond schema validation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Add secure token storage for RTM API credentials
- [ ] Implement proper error sanitization to avoid leaking sensitive information
- [ ] Add telemetry for security events

## Completed Work

Key implementation details:

- Use structured logging with consistent context
- Include connection ID and request ID in all logs
- Create exportable metrics
