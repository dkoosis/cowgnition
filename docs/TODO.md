7. Document package organization in PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md
```

#### 1.8 AI-Friendly Project Structure Improvements (PRIORITY FOCUS)

```
Restructure the project to be more discoverable and reduce duplication, especially for AI assistants:

1. Centralized Utility Functions:
   - Create a dedicated util package for all general-purpose utilities
   - Move existing helper functions from test files into appropriate util subpackages (util/url, util/string, etc.)
   - Add comprehensive godoc comments that explain function purpose, inputs/outputs, and edge cases

2. Test Helper Organization:
   - Create an internal/testutil package for all test helpers
   - Move common test functions (readResource, callTool, withRetry) to this package
   - Use consistent naming for test helpers (e.g., prefix with Assert or Test)
   - Add documentation describing when to use each helper

3. Package Boundaries and Dependencies:
   - Review and refactor circular dependencies
   - Ensure each package has a clear single responsibility
   - Replace package-level function variables with direct imports and calls
   - Add package-level documentation explaining purpose and contents

4. File Organization:
   - Create consistent patterns for file organization within packages
   - Add file-level comments describing the file's contents and purpose
   - Consider splitting large files with mixed responsibilities
   - Use standard file naming conventions (e.g., helpers.go, models.go, etc.)

5. Documentation Enhancements:
   - Add explicit cross-references in comments (e.g., "See also: util.FindURLEndIndex")
   - Update PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md to document the new structure
   - Create a UTILITY_FUNCTIONS.md listing all available helpers by category
   - Add examples in godoc comments showing function usage

6. Naming and Conventions:
   - Establish and document consistent naming patterns
   - Rename confusing or abbreviated functions to be more descriptive
   - Use full words rather than abbreviations in function and variable names
   - Apply consistent casing (camelCase for unexported, PascalCase for exported)
```

#### 1.9 Next Phase Steps for Code Reorganization

```
Continue the code reorganization with these specific steps:

1. Update imports in affected files:
   - Identify all files that would benefit from using the new utility packages
   - Update their imports and replace duplicated code with utility calls
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions across all imports
   - Remove any redundant utility functions from original files

2. Split the large protocol_validators.go file:
   - Extract resource validation into resource_validator.go
   - Extract tool validation into tool_validator.go
   - Move generic response validation to response_validator.go
   - Ensure proper imports and avoid circular dependencies

3. Reorganize the test directory structure:
   - Create subdirectories in test/conformance by test category
   - Move error tests, resource tests, and tool tests to appropriate subdirectories
   - Update imports and references in all test files
   - Ensure tests continue to pass after reorganization

4. Update documentation:
   - Update PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md with the new structure
   - Create a UTILITY_FUNCTIONS.md to document available utilities
   - Add package documentation for each new utility package
   - Update examples to use the new utilities
```

   - Refactor complex logic into smaller, named helper functions

2. Directory Structure:
   - Flatten directory hierarchy to maximum 2-3 levels deep
   - Use meaningful package names rather than excessive nesting
   - Group related functionality by domain rather than technical type
   - Eliminate redundant subdirectories

3. Navigation and Discovery Aids:
   - Add "SECTION:" marker comments to denote logical blocks of code
   - Create a CODEBASE_MAP.md with high-level overview of key files
   - Document common cross-file workflows and interactions
   - Add TOC-style comments at the top of larger files

4. Standardized Documentation:
   - Create template comment blocks for common structures
   - Standardize function header format for params, returns, examples
   - Add /examples folder with self-contained usage examples
