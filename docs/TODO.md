### 2. MCP Protocol Compliance

**Status:** Complete

CowGnition fully implements the MCP specification. This involved:

# CowGnition - MCP Server Implementation Roadmap

## TOP Priority: Test Directory Reorganization

Next steps:

1. Consolidate validator code between test/mcp/ and test/mcp/conformance/

   - Focus on removing duplicate functions in validators.go and resources_test.go
   - Create single source of truth for validators

2. Resolve test package organization

   - Clear separation between mcp/conformance and base mcp tests
   - Fix import patterns to prevent circular dependencies

3. Document test structure
   - Create TESTING_GUIDELINES.md with organizational principles

- **Validation against official MCP documentation:**

  - [x] Compared current implementation with protocol requirements.
  - [x] Identified any missing capabilities or endpoints.
  - [x] Verified message formats and response structures.
  - [x] Ensured proper error handling format (JSON-RPC 2.0).

- **Complete protocol implementation:**

  - [x] Proper initialization sequence and capability reporting.
  - [x] Complete resource definitions and implementations.
  - [x] Proper tool registration and execution.
  - [x] Support for standardized error formats (JSON-RPC 2.0).

- **Conformance verification:**
  - [x] Comprehensive conformance test suite created (`test/mcp/`).
  - [x] All required protocol endpoints tested.
  - [x] Correct schema validation verified.
  - [x] Protocol flows and error scenarios tested.

### 3. Core MCP Functionality Completion (RTM Integration)

**Status:** Complete

Essential RTM integration via the MCP protocol is complete.

- **Resource implementations:**

  - [x] Tasks resources with filtering (today, tomorrow, week, all).
  - [x] Lists resources with complete attributes.
  - [x] Tags resources and hierarchy.
  - [x] Proper resource formatting with consistent styles.

- **Tool implementations:**

  - [x] Complete task management tools (add, complete, delete).
  - [x] List management capabilities.
  - [x] Tag management operations.
  - [x] Authentication and status tools.

- **Response handling:**
  - [x] Consistent MIME types and formatting.
  - [x] Proper parameter validation and error responses (JSON-RPC 2.0).
  - [x] Complete response schemas.

### 4. Authentication and Security

**Status:** Complete

RTM authentication flow is enhanced and secure.

- **Authentication flow improvements:**

  - [x] Streamlined user experience.
  - [x] Clear instructions in auth resources.
  - [x] Handle expired or invalid tokens gracefully.

- **Security enhancements:**
  - [x] Secure token storage and encryption (using `internal/auth/token_manager.go`).
  - [x] Parameter validation and sanitization.
  - [x] Rate limiting protection (`internal/rtm/rate_limiter.go`).
  - [x] Proper error handling for auth failures.

### 5. Testing and Verification

**Status:** In Progress

A comprehensive testing suite is being created and refined.

- **Protocol conformance tests:**

  - [x] Tests for all MCP endpoints against specification (`test/mcp/`).
  - [x] Validation of response formats and schemas.
  - [x] Testing of error conditions and handling.
  - [x] Verification of protocol flow sequences.

- **RTM integration tests:**

  - [x] Authentication flow tests.
  - [x] Verification of task, list, and tag operations.
  - [x] API error handling tests.
  - [x] Validation of resource and tool implementations.
  - [ ] Implement end-to-end integration tests with live RTM API (optional).

- **Test automation:**
  - [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD automated testing.
  - [ ] Create reproducible test environments with Docker containers.
  - [ ] Add performance benchmarks for key operations.
  - [ ] Implement code coverage reporting and enforcement.
