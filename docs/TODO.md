   - ✅ Lists resources with complete attributes
   - ✅ Tags resources and hierarchy
   - ✅ Proper resource formatting with consistent styles

1. ✅ Tool implementations:

   - ✅ Complete task management tools (add, complete, delete)
   - ✅ List management capabilities
   - ✅ Tag management operations
   - ✅ Authentication and status tools

1. ✅ Response handling:
