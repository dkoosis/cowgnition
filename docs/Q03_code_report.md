File & Directory Naming Assessment Report
üìÑ Project Context Summary
The project, CowGnition, is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implemented in Go. Its purpose is to connect Remember The Milk (RTM) tasks with clients like Claude Desktop. It uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over NDJSON via stdio for communication. Key architectural components include configuration management, MCP protocol handling (tools, resources, etc.), middleware for validation, schema handling, and a transport layer. ADRs guide error handling and schema validation strategies. Standard Go formatting and conventions are expected. File names should ideally be snake_case.

üí• Potential Name Clashes Identified
Files: main.go (in cmd/ and cmd/schema_test/), errors.go (in internal/mcp/mcp_errors/ and potentially internal/transport/ if renamed), transport.go (in internal/transport/ and potentially internal/rtm/transport/ if created)
Directories: server/ (in cmd/ and internal/), transport/ (in internal/ and internal/rtm/)

‚ö†Ô∏è Actionable Improvements (Worst to Best)
üî¥ Item: cmd/server/http*server.go (Type: File)
Assessment: Needs Improvement - Misleading
Justification: Name strongly implies HTTP-specific server logic, but the file contains the main server runner (RunServer) which defaults to and primarily implements STDIO transport logic. This conflicts with semantic accuracy.
Suggestions:
(Critical Refactor) Rename to: runner.go - Rationale: Accurately reflects its role in running the server process.
(Critical Refactor) Rename to: server_runner.go - Rationale: More explicit about running the server.
üî¥ Item: cmd/setup.go (Type: File)
Assessment: Needs Improvement - Unclear/Ambiguous
Justification: "setup" is too generic. The content primarily focuses on configuring Claude Desktop integration, not general application setup (which might be inferred). The name lacks specificity.
Suggestions:
(Recommended Rename) Rename to: claude_setup.go - Rationale: Clearly states the specific setup being performed.
(Recommended Rename) Rename to: desktop_integration.go - Rationale: Describes the feature area.
üü° Item: internal/mcp/helpers.go (Type: File)
Assessment: Needs Improvement - Generic
Justification: Standard Go practice often discourages generic helpers or utils packages. While minor here (only mustMarshalJSON\* functions), the name doesn't convey specific purpose. Functions could potentially live closer to their usage or in a more specific utility package if more accumulate.
Suggestions:
(Minor Improvement) Action: Evaluate if mustMarshalJSON functions can be moved to types.go or another more specific location. - Rationale: Improves locality and reduces reliance on a generic helper file.
(Acceptable) Keep as is if it remains small and focused on MCP marshalling helpers.
üü° Item: internal/mcp/handler.go (Type: File)
Assessment: Acceptable (Borderline Generic/Unclear)
Justification: Defines the main Handler struct for MCP methods. While "handler" is somewhat generic, its scope within the internal/mcp package provides context. The splitting of specific handlers into handlers*\*.go files helps clarify.
Suggestions:
(Minor Improvement) Rename to: mcp_handler.go or core_handler.go - Rationale: Slightly more specific, but possibly redundant given the package name.
(Acceptable) Keep as is, relying on package context.
üü° Item: internal/rtm/ (Type: Directory)
Assessment: Empty/Placeholder
Justification: This directory exists, implying RTM integration logic, but contains only an empty transport/ subdirectory. It's currently a placeholder.
Suggestions:
(Review Purpose) Action: Implement RTM logic or remove the directory if RTM integration is not planned soon. - Rationale: Empty directories can be confusing.
üü° Item: File naming convention (http_server.go)
Assessment: Needs Improvement - Inconsistent
Justification: The contributing guidelines suggest snake_case for file names, but http_server.go uses it, while most other multi-word files do not (e.g., mcp_server.go, transport_errors.go). Consistency should be chosen (either adopt snake_case widely or stick to Go's typical camelCase/single word convention).
Suggestions:
(Recommended Rename) Action: Choose a consistent convention (likely stick to Go standard non-snake_case like mcpServer.go or single words) and apply it, renaming http_server.go (e.g., to serverRunner.go) and potentially others like mcp_server.go. - Rationale: Consistency improves readability.
